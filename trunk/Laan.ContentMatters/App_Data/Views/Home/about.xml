    <h1>About the Laan Family web site</h1>
    <p>
        This web site is built using a custom <wiki href="Content Management System">CMS</wiki> called Laan.ContentMatters. It is still an early work in progress, 
        but already allows end user design, layout and content generation of web pages using dynamic data and template expansions. 
        However, the current implementation has no UI, and thus requires a good working knowledge of both <wiki>XML</wiki>, 
        <wiki>HTML</wiki>, and <wiki>CSS</wiki>.
        
        It works by merging templated XML segments into a final XML document, which is output as <wiki>XHTML</wiki>. It 
        provides a full templating, data-aware content system that is entirely configurable via the file system.
