    <h1>Welcome to the Laan Family web site</h1>
    <p>by B. Laan</p>
    <p>
        This web site is built using my custom CMS called Laan.ContentMatters. It is still an early work in progress, 
        but already allows end user design, layout and content of web pages. The current implementation has no UI, and thus
        requires a good working knowledge of both XML, HTML, and CSS.
        
        It works by merging templated XML segments into a final XML document, which is output as XHTML. It provides a full templating,
        data-aware content system that is entirely configurable via files.
